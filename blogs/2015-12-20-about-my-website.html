    I started developing this Github Page website about half year ago.
    The perpose of this website was record and share my experiences during the development.
    However, I did not keep updating this website very often because of many reasons.
    After found many interesting new things to explore, I think now is a good chance for me to pick up this blog page.

<p>
    The last version of this blog site was using React with Require JS,
    and the data came from Azure web services.
    I am not very satisfied with this design because Require JS does not really work well with node modules,
    and it has no support with compiling code. Therefore I updated the website using Webpack with React Router.
    It also helps me to compile sass for styling.

<p>
    Github Page is a static page, there are many limitations for adding functionality on this website.
    However, now I think static page is enough for a blog page and there is no need to build API services for this.
    So now I just manually add HTML file if there is a new blog and update the blog config file. Simple and efficient!

<p>
    Finally this blog uses a web template from HTML5 UP and I refactor the components with React classes.
    I hope this will be a good start for me to drive learning from writing. :)
