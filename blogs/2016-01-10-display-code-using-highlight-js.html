<p>As the propose of this website is writing tech blog, it is very important to give a good view of example codes.
    &quot;pre&quot; and &quot;code&quot; tags provide the developers possibility to use HTML on their website,
    but the styling and keyword highlight still need effort to do.</p>

<p>Fortunately, there is a greatlibrary called Highlight JS can help us achieve this goal.
    Just few lines of code following the <a href="https://highlightjs.org/usage/" style="color: rgb(7, 130, 193);">Highlight JS guide,</a>
    you will be able to customize your code in the website.</p>

<p>Although it is possible to use NPM to install the Highlight JS package,
    I still prefer to directly reference the JavaScript file because I can customize what I need to support in this library.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the component did mount function on my blog jsx file, I initialized the Highlight JS function:</p>

<pre>
    <code>
        hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad();
    </code>
</pre>


<p>After the HTML has been loaded to the DOM, I applied all texts in &quot;pre&quot; &quot;code&quot; tags with the seleted style:</p>

<pre>
    <code class="jsx javascript">
        $.get(blogUrl + ".html", (htmlContent) => {
            this.setState({htmlContent: htmlContent}, () => {
                $('pre code').each((i, block) => {
                    hljs.highlightBlock(block);
                });
            });
        });
    </code>
</pre>

<p>Then it works! Really simple, isn&#39;t it?</p>
