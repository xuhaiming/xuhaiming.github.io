            I am a software engineer who is currently specialized on Node.js web development.
            I have been worked with many frontend frameworks such as Marionette (Backbone), Angular, React and Vue.
            But my favourites are React with Redux and Vue with Vuex.
            I like build Node applications with Express or Koa in ES6/7 syntax, which is really fun.
            Thanks to my current project, I have also experienced developing responsive web application for different device on different platforms.
            Besides of Javascript, C# is another one of my most favourite programming languages.
            I developed ASP .NET applications and Windows UWP apps on Azure platform few years ago, which are also quite interesting.
            It is a pity that I did not have many chances to get deep into the virtual reality area after my graduation.
            It was really valuable experiences to work with all kinds of VR devices.
            Hope I can do something fancy with them someday in the future.
