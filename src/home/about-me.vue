                    <p class="left-align light">I am a software engineer who is currently specialized on web development. It is great to work with the latest Node JS features and experience frameworks such as Vue JS or React JS. Besides of Javascript, C# is another one of my most favourite programming languages. I have been developing ASP .NET applications and Windows UWP apps on Azure platform for few years, which are also quite interesting. It is a pity that I did not have many chances to deep into the virtual reality area after my graduation at university. It was really valuable experiences to work with all kinds of VR devices and hopefully I can do something fancy with them someday in the future.</p>
